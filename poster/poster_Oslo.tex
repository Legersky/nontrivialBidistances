\block{Abstract}{
It is well known that Laman graphs characterize minimal planar structures which are rigid for a generic choice of distances between vertices. We focus on a non-generic choice of distances which lead to a nonrigid structure. It appears that there is a connection between these labelings and another edge labeling which is called bidistance. 

We introduce a notion of \trcomps{} which provides tools to determine a bidistance and nonrigid labelling in some cases.

\emph{A bidistance} of a graph $G$ is an edge labeling $\delta:E_G\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ such that for every cycle in $G$, neither 0 or 1 occurs exactly once. A bidistance is \emph{nontrivial} iff $\delta(E_G)=\{0,1\}$.

\block{\trcomps{}}{
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a connected graph. % such that all vertices are in some triangle $C_3\subset G$. 
We define a relation on $E_G\times E_G$ by 
$$e_1 \sim_{\!\!\bigtriangleup} e_2 \iff  \exists\, C_3\subset G: e_1, e_2\in C_3\,.$$
Let $E_1, \dots, E_n$ be equivalence classes of the reflexive and transitive closure of $\sim_{\!\!\bigtriangleup}$ on $E_G$. The subgraph $T_i=(V_i,E_i)$ of $G$, where  $V_i=\{v\in V | \exists\, e\in E_i \colon v\in e\}$, is called a \emph{\trcomp{} (triangle-component)} iff $|E_i|\geq 3$, and a \emph{connecting edge} otherwise. %A vertex is called \emph{connecting vertex} if it contained in more than one \trcomps{} or connecting edges.

%A vertex $v\in V$ is called \emph{multiple vertex of multiplicity} $k$ if there exists exactly $k$ distinct \trcomps{} which contain $v$. A vertex $u\in V$ is called \emph{connecting vertex} if it is a multiple vertex or an endpoint of some connecting edge.

%Let $T$ be a \trcomp{} of a graph $G$. The following statements hold:
%\begin{itemize}
%	%\item $|E_T|\geq 2|V_T|-3$.
%%	\item If $\delta$ is a bidistance of $G$, then for all $e,e'\in E_T$, $\delta(e)=\delta(e')$.
%	\item The \trcomp{} $T$ has no nontrivial bidistance and hence no nonrigid labeling.
%%	\item The \trcomp{} $T$ is a Laman graph iff it is a 2-tree. (A graph $G$ is called \emph{a 2-tree}, if either $G$ is only one edge, or there exist a vertex $v\in V_G$ of degree two, whose neighbours are adjacent and $G\setminus v$ is a 2-tree.)

%	\item Every \trcomp{} is a planar Laman graph.
%	%\item There is no connecting edge with both endpoints in the same \trcomp{}.
%	%\item Any two \trcomps{} can be connected by at most three connecting edges or by one multiple vertex with possibly one connecting edge. If there are three connecting edges, then all three cannot have a common vertex.
%	\item If $c_e$ is the number of all connecting edges in $G$ and $\cv{k}$ is the number of multiple vertices of multiplicity $k$ in $G$, then

	\item There is a vertex which is not in any \trcomp{}. 
%	\item ?? The number of all connecting edges is at least $n$.
%	\item There exists a \trcomp{} in $G$ whose connecting vertices are pairwise nonadjacent.
%	\item There are two distinct \trcomps{} which have only two connecting vertices and they are connected by one of them.
%	\item There is a \trcomp{} connected only with one multiple vertex and one connecting edge.
%	\item ?? There are three \trcomps{} which are pairwise connected by a multiple vertex.
	\item There is a set  $E_{c}$ of connecting edges of $G$ such that $G\setminus E_c$ is disconnected.
